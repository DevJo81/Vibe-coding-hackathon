# 🎮 SmartSpend - Student Financial Management Tool

## 📝 Description
Welcome to my awesome hackathon project! This application was created during the Vibe Coding Hackathon, where I combined creativity, innovation, and technical skills to build something amazing. 

College students receiving financial aid often struggle to manage their limited funds effectively. SmartSpend, a personalized, student-focused financial tool was created to help track loan disbursements or family allowances, create simple budgets, and gain insights into daily spending.

## ✨ Features
- 💰 Tracks HELSB loan deposits or parent/family contributions
- 📊 Set a term-based budget with reminders and spending alerts
- 📈 Visual spending insights tailored to student life
- 🎯 Save for short-term goals like books or groceries
- 📚 Financial literacy tips tailored for Tanzanian youth (e.g., saving in mobile wallets, avoiding predatory loans)
